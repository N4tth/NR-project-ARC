This project focuses on sentiment and rating classification of the Multilingual Amazon Reviews Corpus (MARC). The goal is to predict the review star rating (1–5) based on the review text (title + body), using transformer-based models such as XLM-RoBERTa.

The dataset includes reviews in 6 languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, and Chinese), making it suitable for multilingual sentiment analysis and cross-lingual evaluation.
